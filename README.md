# DNA-Encoder
#### Description
DNA is a very stable and compact storage medium.  The language of DNA consists of four bases, each of which may be thought of as a character in the DNA alphabet.  For our purposes, these characters (in order) are: A, T, G, and C.  We would like to store digital data in DNA!
